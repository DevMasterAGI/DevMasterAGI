- 👋 Hi, I’m @DevMasterAGI

**👀 I’m interested in…**

* Artificial general intelligence (AGI)
* Artificial intelligence (AI)
* Machine learning (ML)
* Developing the most advanced AI & AGI calculator

**🌱 I’m currently learning…**

* Everything I can about AGI, AI, and ML
* How to build complex software systems
* How to lead and manage teams

**💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on…**

* Developing the most advanced AI & AGI calculator
* Other open source AI and ML projects
* Research projects on AGI, AI, and ML

**P.S.**I'm also a big fan of neural networks and creating an advanced neural network for artificial general intelligence. Imagine if a neural network could be used to develop a system that can detect early signs of climate change with buliding accurate climate model via Quantum Computing, economic issues, health predictions of the human body, improve traffic management systems,  and predict and suggest ways to protect future farming and water resources.
This system could then be used to alert foresters to potential problems so that they can take corrective action.
